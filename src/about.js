            <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p>This website was made by Lens Dorsainvil, AKA Lensco, as a project to practice and learn how 
            to use React. By the time you see this i've posted a <a href="https://dev.to/lensco825">Blog</a> that contains an overview on how i made it. 
            All of the images used hear were on Unsplash, with my icons from ion-icon. I'm a 13 year old front end developer hoping to become full stack by high
            school and maybe get a high paying job as a web developer to pay for college! If you have any questions or if you just want to say
            something to me email me at lensdorsainvil711@outlook.com.</p>
