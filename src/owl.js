    <p className="text">Owls are a unique species of birds that have fascinated humans for centuries. These birds are known for their distinct features such as their large eyes, silent flight, and sharp talons. In this research report, we will delve into the fascinating world of owls and explore some of their most interesting characteristics.</p>
    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <p className="text">Owls come in various sizes, with the smallest species being the Elf Owl, which is about 5 inches tall, while the largest species is the Eurasian Eagle Owl, which can grow up to 30 inches tall. They have large heads with a flat face, and their eyes are forward-facing, which gives them excellent depth perception. Their wings are adapted for silent flight, which allows them to sneak up on their prey undetected. Owls also have sharp talons that are used to catch and kill their prey.</p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p className="text">Owls are primarily nocturnal creatures, which means they are active during the night. They are solitary animals and prefer to hunt alone, but some species will hunt in pairs. Owls are also known for their incredible eyesight, which is several times better than humans. They use their eyesight to locate their prey, which can be small mammals, birds, and insects. Owls are also very territorial and will defend their territory fiercely.</p>
    <h3>Habitat</h3>
    <p className="text">Owls can be found all over the world, except for Antarctica. They are found in a variety of habitats, from forests to deserts. Different species of owls have adapted to live in different habitats. For example, the Snowy Owl lives in the Arctic tundra, while the Burrowing Owl lives in the grasslands of North and South America.</p>
    <h3>Threats to Owls</h3>
    <p className="text">Unfortunately, owls face many threats in the wild. One of the biggest threats is habitat loss, as humans continue to encroach on their natural habitats. Owls are also hunted for their feathers and body parts, which are used in traditional medicines. Climate change is also affecting owls, as their habitats are changing, and their prey is becoming scarce.</p>
